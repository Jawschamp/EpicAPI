This is a shitty file i put togeather that does stupid things

Auth File made by https://github.com/Londiuh/FN-endpoint-get

To run this, run EpicData.py
and follow what it says to get see the endpoint, Unfrotuaklly i don't have a working auth so, you have to do it manually IK it sucks i've looked into in if you know how to fix it please dm me or open a pull request!
The Problem:
* I can't seem to figure out how Epic knows your logged in, I'm assuming it's a cookie, but I don't know witch one

Description oon what this does:
* It will give you the news for Fortnite
* It will give you Item Shop Data
* It will give you Free Games that Epic is giving away!
* It gives you Live modes, (Only for NAW) for now
